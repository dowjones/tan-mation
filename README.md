# TanMation Tool
# ==============

Overview:

TanMation tool was developed to take an advantage from Tanium save questions, since Tanium provides a great way to extract real-time data quickly from the thousands of endpoints.  That was why we leverage Tanium to extract the data and use TanMation tool to analyze the Tanium output data for malware.  We built this tool to help our cyber security team to analyze a large amount of data provided by Tanium in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.  On another note, this tool will help save time for threat hunting and produce less false positives.  TanMation uses VirusTotal to compare signatures since VirusTotal has a total of 68 AVs built-in.
